STORED PROCEDURES:
-------------------
 1. The store procedures define functions for creating triggers or custom aggregate functions.
 2. In addition, stored procedures also add many procedural features e.g., control structures and complex calculation.
 3. These allow you to develop custom functions much easier and more effective.

Syntax:
	create [or replace] procedure procedure_name(parameter_list)
	language plpgsql
	as $$
	declare
	-- variable declaration
	begin
	-- stored procedure body
	end; $$


Advantages of using PostgreSQL stored procedures:
------------------------------------------------
=> The stored procedures bring many advantages as follows:

	1. Reduce the number of round trips between applications and database servers.
	2. All SQL statements are wrapped inside a function stored in the PostgreSQL database server so the application only has to issue a function call 
	 to get the result back instead of sending multiple SQL statements and wait for the result between each call.
	3. Increase application performance because the user-defined functions and stored procedures are pre-compiled and stored in the PostgreSQL 
	database server.
	4. Reusable in many applications. Once you develop a function, you can reuse it in any applications.

Disadvantages of using PostgreSQL stored procedures:
----------------------------------------------------
=> Besides the advantages of using stored procedures, there are some caveats:

	1. Slowness in software development because stored procedure programming requires specialized skills that many developers do not possess.
	2. Difficult to manage versions and hard to debug.
	3. May not be portable to other database management systems e.g., MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server.
